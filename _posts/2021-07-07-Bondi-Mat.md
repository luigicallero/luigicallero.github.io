Cryptocurrency adoption is still a challenge for people in general. At least, here in Argentina, it is unusual to see stores receiving bitcoin or other tokens as payment.
When discussing with my teammate and friend [Juan Meregone](https://www.linkedin.com/in/juanmeregone) what was to be our next development for our second Blockchain Hackathon (Polygon-Grants Hackathon)[https://www.polygongrantshackathon.com/], of course the adoption topic was in our heads.

Still, it was not clear what road to take. Juan mentioned he was on the way to work and as we were chatting over the phone, he mentioned he was already on the bus. Eureka!... Public Transportation!!: that is an important part of our daily life.
To help overcome the barriers of this gap between our daily life and the blockchain world, we decided to develop a tool that would make it easy to buy bus tickets with cryptocurrencies.

### Hackathon Bounty Selection
Among the many bounties offered by the participating sponsors, we decided to go for a bounty prize sponsored by the hackathon host: Polygon (ex-MATIC), 
Bounty's challenge was described as "Surprise Us! We are always looking for innovation and creativity and this track is exactly for that"; which fit perfectly with our idea. So, I started to work on the backend (Solidity, Truffle, Polygon Testnet) while Juan took care of the frontend (ReactJS, CSS, barcode).

### Bounty Challenge:
These were the 2 requirements set by the sponsor:
  All submissions must be deployed on the Polygon Testnet or mainnet.
  A demo video and Github repo link must be submitted for a complete submission.
And these were the factors to be considered by the judges:
The following factors will be considered when deciding winners:
	Originality of the idea
	User experience (good design, intuitive, easy to use)

### Smart Contract
Bondimat.sol Smart Contract was developed during the hackathon

### Deployment to Polygon TestNet
Deployed in Polygon Mumbai...

### MVP
This dApp can not be considered a final product, but was mainly developed as an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) to showcase the hackathon judges, the possibles usage in real life of cryptocurrency.
We were not ...
