Cryptocurrency adoption is still a challenge for people in general. At least, here in Argentina, it is unusual to see stores receiving bitcoin or other tokens as payment.
When discussing with my teammate and friend [Juan Meregone](https://www.linkedin.com/in/juanmeregone) what was to be our next development for our second Blockchain Hackathon [Polygon-Grants Hackathon](https://www.polygongrantshackathon.com/), of course, the adoption topic was in our heads.

Still, it was not clear what road to take. Juan mentioned he was on the way to work and as we were chatting over the phone, he mentioned he was already on the bus. Eureka!... Public Transportation!!: that is an important part of our daily life.
To help overcome the barriers of this gap between our daily life and the blockchain world, we decided to develop an application that would make it easy to buy bus tickets with cryptocurrencies.

### Hackathon Bounty Selection
Among the many bounties offered by the participating sponsors, we decided to go for a bounty prize sponsored by the hackathon host: Polygon (ex-MATIC), 

Bounty's challenge was described as "Surprise Us! We are always looking for innovation and creativity and this track is exactly for that"; which fit perfectly with our idea. 

So, I started to work on the backend (**Solidity, Truffle, Polygon Testnet**) while Juan took care of the frontend (ReactJS, CSS, barcode generator).

### Bounty Challenge:
The following requirements were necessary to consider a project acceptable for this bounty:
  1. All submissions must be deployed on the **Polygon** Testnet or mainnet.
  2. A **demo video** and **Github repository** link must be submitted for a complete submission.

And these were the factors to be considered by the judges:
  1. Originality of the idea
  
	2. User experience (good design, intuitive, easy to use)

### Smart Contract
I developed Bondimat.sol Smart Contract during the hackathon period of 4 weeks (dedicating 1 or 2 hours at most, due to my full-time job) using my previous projects and other tutorials.

I can not but mention those great contributors to the blockchain education on youtube that were my inspiration during this project:
 - How to Model a traveler using Struct from Greg at DappUniversity: https://www.dappuniversity.com/articles/solidity
 - How to send Ether to smart contract from Julian at EattheBlocks: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4k_ak3SFczc
 - How to use States with enum from Escrow contract at Blockgeeks: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Mry6oAQVXU 
 - Add events from Hotelbooking from Greg dappuniversity: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB1SahPR0MQ
 - Reuse of "book" function from Flight Contract: https://github.com/smallbatch-apps/fairline-contract/blob/master/contracts/Flight.sol

<tweet>Sponsors Support during Hackathons is a great help for developers!!!</tweet> 

### Deployment to Polygon TestNet
After several tests on the truffle development local blockchain, I deployed the smart contract in Polygon testnet named Mumbai using a [global RPC](https://docs.matic.network/docs/develop/network-details/network) provided by Polygon.

You can find my last deployment of the contract at [0x57d487B3c13a44108502297171b276c4e64eC41c](https://mumbai.polygonscan.com/address/0x57d487B3c13a44108502297171b276c4e64eC41c)


### MVP
This dApp can not be considered a final product but was mainly developed as an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) to showcase the hackathon judges the possible usage in real life of cryptocurrency.


### Hackathon Final Presentation
Sadly we did not win any prize in this bounty challenge, but we were glad to get our app at least partially functional. But the opportunity to push my out of my comfort zone and see what I can do with the coding skills I have acquired in such a brief period, really made the effort worth it.

And finally here is the video I made for Bondi-Mat's presentation at the hackathon:

<tweet>Absolutely recommend hackathons as a place to capture new tools, develop new contacts, and gain experience in this rapidly growing world of blockchain development.</tweet>
